          About 1.4 billion hectares of <br />agricultural land are used for

          While vast amounts of food are <br />
          discarded, millions face hunger. <br />
          Wasting food reflects inequality in <br />
          distribution, as resources that could <br />
          alleviate food insecurity are lost. <br /><br />
          <b>Issue: </b> Ethical

        <div class="description probcoex">
          Due to aesthetic standards, large <br />
          amounts of perfectly edible foods are <br />
          often rejected for not meeting certain <br />

          Excessive production of food, <br />
          especially in industrial agriculture, <br />
          often leads to surpluses that can't be <br />

          Food waste in landfills generates <br />

          Without proper refrigeration, climate <br />

          The absence of comprehensive food <br />
